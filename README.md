# Cpp-Quiz-game

This is a simple quiz script project I saw on the Interet. <br> Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2BQUXf91ZA&list=PLOYHgt8dIdozvOVheSRb_qPVU-4ZJA7uB&index=2 <br>

I modified its initial version so that it asks questions in random order. It also gives feedback on whether 
the chosen answer is correct and gives choice to end the game before running out of questions. <br>
Questions used in the game are read from questions.txt file. You can put whatever questions you like, as long as the pattern is the same as in the uploaded version of the file (1st row - question, 2nd to 5th row - answers, 6th row - correct answer)
